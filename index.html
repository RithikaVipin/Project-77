    <p>Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. It is used to 
        develop computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. Visual Studio
        uses Microsoft software development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation
        Foundation,Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight. It can produce both native code and managed
        code.</p>

    <p>Windows Console is the infrastructure for console applications in Microsoft Windows. An instance of 
       a Windows Console has a screen buffer and an input buffer. It allows console apps to run inside
       a window or in hardware text mode (so as to occupy the entire screen). The user can switch between
       the two using the Alt+â†µ Enter key combination. The text mode is unavailable in Windows Vista and later.
       Starting with Windows 10, however, a native full-screen mode is available.</p>
